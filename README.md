### Architecture

`SyntheticaAI` is deeply integrated with data science and machine learning workflows, the file structure is logically organized to handle various components such as data processing, model training, API endpoints, and web interfaces. This file structure accommodates scalability and the complex nature of the project:

```

This structure is designed with best practices for both software development and data science in mind. It keeps data, models, and code for processing and serving predictions separate but accessible. The use of Docker ensures that the setup can be easily replicated, facilitating both development and deployment processes.

The separation of concerns is a key theme, with data processing, model management, API endpoints, and web application code isolated from one another to prevent any one area from becoming overly complex or unmanageable as the project scales.

Each sub-directory should contain its own README file explaining the specifics of that directory to maintain clarity as new developers join the project or as it expands over time. The `tests` directory ensures that all aspects of `SyntheticaAI` remain reliable and maintain high quality as new features and models are added.
